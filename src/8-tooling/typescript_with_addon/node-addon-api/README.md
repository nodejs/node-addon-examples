## TypeScript calls JavaScript that calls C++ that calls C function

### Build and run:

```
npm install
npm test
```

The result:

```
This is a TypeScript class constructor.
This is a Javascript function.
This is a C++ function.
This is a C function.
```

This is using cmake and cmake-js based on the example [build_with_cmake](../../build_with_cmake)
